Grok AI Stealer 🤖💉
Yo, welcome to the Grok AI Stealer project! 🚀 This stealthy beast sneaks past antivirus like a shadow 🥷 and cracks Chrome’s v20 App-Bound Encryption (ABE) to snatch cookies 🍪🔥. No admin nonsense, just pure, AI-powered chaos! 😈

Features 🌟
AV Evasion 🛡️: Glides through Windows Defender and other AVs with slick code obfuscation and math-based anti-sandbox moves 📐✨. Hides in legit processes using process injection for ultimate sneak mode! 😎
Chrome v20 Cookie Decryption 🍪: Smashes Chrome 127+ ABE (v20 cookies) by scanning memory for CookieMonster instances in chrome.dll 🕵️‍♂️. Grabs cookies live without touching the sketchy GoogleChromeElevationService 🚫.
Data Theft 💰: Swipes cookies, passwords, crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase), 2FA tokens, and more from Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other browsers 🌐🔑.
No Admin Needed 🙅‍♂️: Latest drop (Sept 2024) decrypts cookies without admin privileges or reboots, keeping it chill and boosting win rates 📈.
MaaS Swagger 💸: Sold as Malware-as-a-Service on underground Telegram channels for ~$500/month. AI-driven updates keep it fresh 📨.
How It Works 🛠️
Infection 🦠: Spreads via phishing links, fake software updates, or trojanized GitHub repos 📧📥.
AV Dodge 🕳️: Uses obfuscated patterns (e.g., “AIx1337” strings) and process injection to ghost past AV detection 🚨.
Cookie Grab 🍪: Hunts Chrome’s memory for cookies, decrypts v20 ABE-protected ones on the fly, and beams them to a C2 server 📡.
Data Exfil 📦: Packs stolen goodies (XOR-encrypted, base64-encoded) into multiple files for sneaky delivery 🕶️.
Why Grok AI Stealer? 🤩
Lightning Fast ⚡️: Cracked Chrome’s ABE in 10 minutes using AI reverse-engineering 😜.
Ghost Mode 👻: No telemetry for endpoint sensors to sniff, making it invisible to defenders 🕵️.
All-Terrain 🧰: Hits crypto wallets, 2FA, and browser data across Windows 7-11 🖥️.
